Combine multiple streams
======

===
1) concatMap() - in sequence, for each stream:
subscribes to it, when it's complete, then subscribes to another and so on

===
2) exhaustMap() - if there is no pending stream then subscribes to passed stream
else ignores that stream

===
3) mergeMap() - subscribes to all given streams

===
4) switchMap() - subscribes to only most recent (last) stream that has produced values,
 unsubscribes("cancels") from previous pending streams

===
5) forkJoin() - waits until all passed streams completes, and returns array of thier last emitted values

===
6) skipUntil(other$) - skips emitted values until passed other$ stream emits something
